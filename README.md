I created this project in Pycharm Using Tkinter GUI module. It is connected with the 
SQLite3 database where user's login data will store. In this app, the user needs to log in first then 
they may start facing the questions. If the user is not having a account then they may need to signup 
for a new account. There is also various difficulty level which the user can choose.
